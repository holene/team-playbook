# IDOARRT Meeting Design

IDOARRT is a simple tool to support you to lead an effective meeting or group process by setting out a clear purpose, structure, and goals at the very beginning. It aims to enable all participants to understand every aspect of the meeting or process, which helps to create psychological safety in the group. The acronym stands for Intention, Desired Outcome, Agenda, Rules, Roles and Responsibilities, and Time.

## Step 1:
Before the meeting/process, prepare an online Slide (remote workshop) or a flipchart (face-to-face) outlining all the points of IDOARRT. See below:

**Intention** – What is the intention, or purpose, of the meeting? In other words, why have it?

**Desired Outcome(s)** – What specific outcomes should be achieved by the end of the meeting?

**Agenda** – What activities will the group go through, in what order, to move toward the desired outcome?

**Roles** – What roles or responsibilities need to be in place for the meeting to run smoothly? Who is facilitating, and who is participating? Who is documenting, and who is keeping track of the time? What do you expect of the participants?

**Rules** – What guidelines will be in place during the meeting? These could relate to agreed group norms. They could also relate to the use of other apps, or practical rules related to learning space. Let the participants add rules to ensure that they have ownership of them.

**Time** – What is the expected time for the meeting, including breaks, and at what time will the meeting end?


## Step 2:
At the beginning of the meeting, introduce the IDOARRT, going through point by point.

You might choose to invite participants to ask questions or make suggestions.

Once the group is happy with the plan, go ahead with the rest of the meeting.
